1. "Employee-Salary-Prediction.ipynb" file contains the code for the model.
- The data has been thoroughly preprocessed, and then careful model selection, training and evaluation has been done to achieve an accuracy of "87.137" 
- XGBoost Machine Learning algorithm has been used to train the best model and for further prediction.


2. *"adult.csv"* is the dataset that has been used for employee salary predicition.
- This dataset originally contains several columns (age, workclas, fnlwgt, education, educational-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, gender, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country, income)
- Out of all the attributes, 'income' was used as the output attribute, some were dropped as they were redundant for the prediction and rest were used for the prediction.
